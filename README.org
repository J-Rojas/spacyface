* Spacyface aligner
[[https://spacy.io/][Spacy]] is a fantastic python library for extracting linguistic information about word tokens in a block of text, and the team has painstakingly created special rules to handle the many exceptions in the English language.

[[https://github.com/huggingface][Huggingface]] makes transformer networks in both tensorflow and pytorch accessible to a broader audience and makes development easier with a unified API across different models.

This repository aims to combine the language understanding of Spacy's tokenization schemes with the tokenization schemes of the different implementation of the models in Huggingface.

Originally created to ease the development of [[http://exbert.net/][exbert]], these tools have been made available for others to use in their own projects as they see fit.

Currently, the repository only supports the English language.
